Working on my final project has been an interesting, challenging process. Words cannot stress how challenging it is to persist data from the front-end to the back end, and **then** make an API call to have that information dynamically persist.

There are no words for how challenging this was.

But nonetheless, it was... rewarding. Every time I ran into a bug, I found myself learning so much about React, Redux and thunk middleware. I found myself so much more appreciative of Redux, and my understanding of how information is passed is alot strong than it used to be.

component => action => reducer => component

Nonetheless, there is so much to learn. 

For me, my primary takeaway was the importance of systematic debugging. I've learned from some seriously knowledgeable people that thinking about where the code is going helps you get a baseline expectation to compare the bug to. It's also made me much more interested in creating another React app that uses Rails as the backend. Being able to develop a full stack React app was a rewarding experience.
