 **So much can change in just a few years.** A few years ago, I saw purpose in politics. Having graduated, I was ready to contribute to society through non-profit work. To me, the greatest contribution I could make was through people. I wanted to help ease the inequity through research or awareness raising. I had been dedicated to this type of work for years, but despite my steadfast dedication, nothing could prepare me for post-graduate reality. 
 
As a 25 year old millenial, my conception of life is fairly... limited. I'm not naive --- there's a lot to learn out there. Nonetheless, I still have my impressions. To me, life isn't a windy road. It's a geographically diverse landscape. Each ridge, valley and mountain is laden with symbolic meaning. Each footstep you take is an impression you leave on others as you move forward, taking with you a deeper understanding of yourself.

This is what led me to Flatiron. After gaining experience at a few non-profits, I realized something was missing. There were aspects of my experience that felt right. Collaborating with different teams and balancing different projects was stimulating. Nevertheless, when I completed my first online course on HTML and CSS, I knew what was missing because I knew I loved coding.

There's something about problem-solving that feels *exhilirating*. When I look at a program, I don't feel intimidated. I feel curious and driven to explore. And I do it 8 hours a day, every day, through Flatiron School's Online Web Developer program. And I love every minute of it.
